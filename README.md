# UFOs

## Overview of Project
This project aimed to craft a table displaying UFO data and to allow users to filter data based on date, city, state, country, and shape through the use of JavaScript. HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to format the website.

## Summary
While this webpage provides a way to retrieve data using filters, users must enter specific filters in order to recieve results. For instance, users must know specific dates UFOs were spotted in order to use the date filter. Additionally, states and countries must be entered in all lowercase and with abbreviations, rather than the entire state name.

### Recommendations
Two boxes for date ranges may allow for a broader yet speciic search, allowing users who do not know the specific dates of UFO spottings to navigate the website. Additionally, the html code may be tweaked in order to allow full state and country names to be used in searches, as well as proper names with capitlaizations.
